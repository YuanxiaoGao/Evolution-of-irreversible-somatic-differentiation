Growth_rate.py: calculated the growth rate of a developmental trajectory.
Growth_rate_at_cg_cs: calculated the growth rates under different parameter spaces.
Generateing_indepent_growth_rate_files: generate the independent files for easy calculation.

Here the cs=2cg is included in the file "Growth_rate.py", where we set the cs=2cg in para[4].
