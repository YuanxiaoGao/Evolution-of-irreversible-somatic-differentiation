In this folder, the X in 0X_code_for_figX is corresponding to the figures in the main text.
In these folders, we list the simulation code files that generate the data used in each figure.

Please note that in some code files, we may include the ideas that contain the organism size effect
and the cell death effect. But we get rid of these non-essential factors for our conclusions at the end.
And our simulation didn't include these two effects, though you may find some extra parameters.
